Types of Recommender Systems

* **Collaborative Filtering**
	* **Memory Based**: Memorizes user-item interaction matrix. There is no dimensionality reduction or model learning. Two variants of Memory based collaborative filtering are:
		* User Based: Uses rating of other similar users to determine rating
		* Item Based: Uses rating of other similar items to determine rating
	* Model Based: Uses dimensionality reduction techniques such as [[Matrix Factorization]] ([[Matrix Factorization#ALS|ALS]]), [[Clustering]], [[Deep Learning]], etc to compare large scale user-item matrix into fewer dimensions. 
* **Content Based Recommender System**
* **Hybrid**:

Based on how feedback is obtained, recommender system can also be classified as:
1. Implicit Feedback 
2. Explicit Feedback
