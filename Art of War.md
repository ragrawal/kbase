Chapter 1: Laying Plans

**All warfare is based on deception**





## In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaings.

* **Cleverness has never seen associated with long delays**. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.
* **A wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy**. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store. 
* **In order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.** Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. 

# Chapter 3: Attack by Stratagem
* **Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting**

Thus we may now that there are five essentials for victory:
1. He will win who knows when to fight adn when not to fight.
2. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
3. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its rank. 
4. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. 
5. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. 

**If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also sufer a defat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.**

# Chapter 4: Tactical Dispositions

**To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, by the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.**
